# Live-Video-Attribute-Analysis
Utilizes a camera to display the predicted attributes about a human subject in view (age, race, gender, emotion) via the Python Library DeepFace.

Based off of the YouTube user NeuralNine's age and gender predictor for static images.

This project combines that functionality with a video display provided by the cv2 library to detect the attributes of a human face in sight of the camera every 30 seconds.
